a = int(input())
b = int(input())
## the creation phase
def suming():
    r = a+b
    print(r)
def sub():
    r = a-b
    print(r)
def sub():
    r = a*b
    print(r)
## now you can consider that you are ueing the function as i said creting is not same as using the function
suming(a,b)
sub(a,b)
sub(a,b)
